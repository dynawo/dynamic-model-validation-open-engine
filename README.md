# Dynamic Model Validation - Open Engine

This repository will soon be populated with the code developed in order to do multiple parameters estimation for power system dynamic models. It will notably contain the implementation of different optimization techniques applied to this particular problem and will be complemented by real data provided as examples of the tool behavior.
It will provide an open-source tool that any interested party can build upon or contribute to.

More details on the tool and methods used can be found in the following reference:
